# Form_Finding

## Introduction
A Form Finding experiment created by using the grasshopper kangaroo Plugin. The mesh/ fabric acts as a tensile structure, where the corners are anchored and few internal points are transformed in Z-direction to manipulate the fabric/mesh. Multiple forms can be created by changing the parameters of an app.
